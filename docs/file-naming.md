# Chapter and lesson file naming conventions

Content is organized in to chapters/units each represented by one directory of files, which become a Jekyll Collection. 
The chapters are given a name in the `_config.yml` under collections.
The chapter directory should start with an underscore, then a number (to put chapters in the correct order), then the title or other designation.
For example, `_01-chapter-one`.

Each Chapter is split into multiple lessons.
Each lesson is one markdown file in the chapter directory.
Name the lessons with a number (to put content in the correct order), then the title or other designation.
For example, `01-lesson-one.md`.
